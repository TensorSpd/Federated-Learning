# Federated CPU Tracker with SyftBox - Day 7 Reflection 🚀

Embarking on the **30 Days of Open Learning** journey has been both challenging and rewarding. On Day 7, I focused on building a **Federated CPU Tracker** using **SyftBox**, a powerful tool for creating privacy-preserving APIs. This project not only enhanced my technical skills but also deepened my understanding of federated learning and privacy-enhancing technologies. 💡🔒

## Project Overview 🛠️

The goal of this project is to develop a tool that monitors real-time average CPU usage across a network of participants. The primary challenge lies in collecting meaningful data without compromising individual privacy or exposing system vulnerabilities. SyftBox serves as the backbone for securely publishing and managing this data within a federated network. 🌐✨

### Key Objectives 🎯

1. **Monitor Local CPU Usage:** Capture real-time CPU metrics efficiently. 📈
2. **Apply Privacy Protections:** Implement techniques to safeguard sensitive data. 🛡️
3. **Securely Publish Data:** Ensure that the aggregated data is shared securely within the network. 🔐

## What I Learned 📚

### Understanding the Use Case 🤔

Initially, I explored the necessity of monitoring CPU usage in a federated network. Such a tool can provide valuable insights into network-wide resource utilization, helping in load balancing, performance optimization, and anomaly detection. However, sharing precise CPU data poses significant security risks. Historical attacks like [**Hertzbleed**](https://www.hertzbleed.com/) and [**PLATYPUS**](https://www.securityweek.com/platypus-hackers-can-obtain-crypto-keys-monitoring-cpu-power-consumption/) have demonstrated how seemingly benign metrics can be exploited to extract sensitive information or compromise system integrity. ⚠️🔍

This understanding underscored the importance of balancing data utility with privacy and security. It became clear that while aggregated data can drive meaningful insights, individual data points must remain protected to prevent potential vulnerabilities. ⚖️🔒

### Embracing Privacy-Enhancing Techniques 🛡️

To address the security concerns associated with sharing CPU usage data, I delved into **Differential Privacy (DP)**. Differential Privacy is a robust framework that introduces controlled noise to data, ensuring that individual contributions remain indistinguishable within the aggregate data. This approach provides a mathematical guarantee that the presence or absence of a single data point does not significantly affect the overall output, thereby preserving privacy. 📊🔐

Implementing DP in the CPU tracker involved calibrating the noise addition to balance privacy and data utility. By adjusting parameters like epsilon and setting appropriate bounds, I ensured that the average CPU utilization remained meaningful while obscuring individual usage metrics. 🎚️🔍

### Structuring the Project 🗂️

Organizing the project structure was a foundational step that facilitated efficient development and maintenance. I created a dedicated folder named `cpu_tracker_member`, which contained two essential scripts:

- **`run.sh`:** Serves as the entry point for the API, managing the execution environment and dependencies. 🖥️🔧
- **`main.py`:** Houses the core API logic, including data collection, privacy processing, and data publication. 🐍📂

This clear separation of concerns not only streamlined the development process but also made the project scalable and easier to manage. 📈🔄

### Developing the API Logic 🧩

The heart of the project lies in the `main.py` script, where the API logic is meticulously crafted. Key components and their functionalities include:

#### CPU Usage Sampling 🖥️📊

Using the `psutil` library, I implemented a mechanism to collect 50 CPU usage samples at 0.1-second intervals. This approach ensures that the data reflects real-time usage patterns while providing a sufficient sample size for accurate averaging. ⏱️📈

#### Folder Permissions and Data Security 🔒📁

Managing data access securely was paramount. I utilized **SyftBox's** permission management features to create two distinct folders:

1. **Restricted Public Folder:**
   - **Purpose:** Stores the noisy (differentially private) CPU usage data. 🗄️🔐
   - **Permissions:** Configured to allow access only to authorized users, such as `aggregator@openmined.org`. 👥✅
   - **Implementation:** Leveraged `SyftPermission` to set precise read permissions, ensuring that only designated entities can access the aggregated data. 🔑📜

2. **Private Folder:**
   - **Purpose:** Stores the actual (non-noisy) CPU usage mean for local access and validation. 📂🔍
   - **Permissions:** Restricted to the current user, preventing unauthorized access. 🚫👤
   - **Implementation:** Similarly managed using `SyftPermission` to enforce strict access controls. 🛠️🔒

This dual-folder strategy ensures that sensitive data remains protected while still enabling the sharing of useful aggregate metrics within the network. 🛡️🌐

#### Data Saving Mechanism 💾📝

The `save` function was designed to handle the storage of CPU usage data. It records both the noisy and actual CPU usage means, along with a timestamp, in their respective folders. This function ensures data integrity and traceability, facilitating future audits or analyses if needed. 🕵️‍♂️📆

### Integrating SyftBox 🔗

Deploying the API involved integrating the `cpu_tracker_member` folder into the SyftBox ecosystem. By placing the folder within the `/SyftBox/apis/` directory, I enabled SyftBox to recognize and manage the API seamlessly. This integration highlighted SyftBox's capabilities in orchestrating secure API deployments within a federated network, reinforcing the importance of structured and secure API management. 🌟🔧

### Running the API ▶️

Executing the API was straightforward, thanks to the well-organized project structure and the functionality encapsulated within `run.sh` and `main.py`. This step marked a significant milestone, transitioning from development to operational status where the API could begin publishing protected CPU usage data to the network. 🎉🚀

## Privacy Considerations 🕵️‍♀️🔒

A critical aspect of this project was ensuring robust privacy measures to protect sensitive CPU usage data. The following techniques were employed to uphold data privacy and security:

### Differential Privacy 📊🔐

By introducing calibrated noise to the CPU usage data, Differential Privacy ensures that individual data points cannot be reverse-engineered or exploited. This technique provides a mathematical guarantee of privacy, making it a cornerstone of the project's privacy strategy. 📐🛡️

### Folder Permissions 📁🔑

Implementing strict folder permissions using SyftBox's `SyftPermission` ensures that only authorized users can access sensitive data. This approach prevents unauthorized entities from accessing or manipulating the data, thereby maintaining its integrity and confidentiality. 🔒✅

### Local Computation 🖥️🏠

All raw CPU usage data remains on the client's machine, never leaving the local environment. This principle of local computation minimizes the risk of data breaches and ensures that sensitive information is not exposed to external threats. 🛡️🔒

## Challenges and Solutions 🧗‍♂️💡

### Balancing Privacy and Data Utility ⚖️📈

One of the primary challenges was calibrating the Differential Privacy parameters to balance data utility with privacy. Setting the epsilon value required careful consideration to ensure that the noisy data remained useful for analysis without compromising individual privacy. Through iterative testing and adjustments, I achieved an optimal balance that maintained data integrity while safeguarding privacy. 🔄🔍

### Managing Permissions Effectively 🔑🔧

Ensuring that folder permissions were correctly configured to allow only authorized access was another critical challenge. Misconfigurations could either expose sensitive data or restrict access unnecessarily. Leveraging SyftBox's permission management tools provided a streamlined way to set and verify permissions, mitigating this risk effectively. 🛠️✅

### Ensuring Scalability 📈🌐

Designing the API to be scalable was essential for its deployment across a federated network. Structuring the project with clear separation of concerns and leveraging SyftBox's robust API management capabilities facilitated scalability, allowing the CPU tracker to handle increased data loads and network participants seamlessly. 🚀🔧

## Moving Forward 🚀🔮

With the foundational API successfully deployed, the next phase involves expanding its capabilities to collect and aggregate CPU usage data across the entire SyftBox network. This will entail developing additional APIs to handle data aggregation, enhancing the differential privacy mechanisms, and ensuring seamless integration with other network components. 🌟🔗
