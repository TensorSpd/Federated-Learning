**Exploring Pre-Built Jobs and Examples in FedML**

Continuing from Yesterday, I dove into [**FedML‚Äôs pre-built jobs and examples**](https://docs.tensoropera.ai/federate/examples), which provide tailored solutions for federated learning (FL) across various domains like NLP, computer vision, graph neural networks, and IoT. These pre-built modules and benchmarks simplify FL implementation, offering researchers and practitioners practical tools to explore diverse use cases.

## **üîç Key Highlights**

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Examples for Diverse FL Scenarios**  
FedML supports simulations, cross-silo FL, and cross-device FL. Its modular architecture works seamlessly with multiple machine learning frameworks, including PyTorch, TensorFlow, JAX, and MXNet.

#### **Example Use Cases**:  
- **Single-Process Simulation**: Quick algorithmic prototyping for small datasets.  
- **Distributed FL**: MPI-based and NCCL-accelerated training for large-scale GPU setups.  
- **Cross-Silo FL**: Secure collaboration across organizations, such as hospitals or banks.  
- **Cross-Device FL**: Federated learning for smartphones and IoT.
